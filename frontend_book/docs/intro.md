# Physical AI & Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Robotics** — a comprehensive, spec-driven guide to building intelligent robots using ROS 2, AI agents, and modern development practices.

## What You'll Learn

This book is designed for **AI and software engineers** entering the world of Physical AI and robotics. You'll learn:

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: The middleware "nervous system" that powers humanoid robots
- **Python Robot Programming**: Building agents with rclpy for real-time robot control
- **Robot Description**: Defining robot structure with URDF for simulation and visualization
- **AI Integration**: Bridging AI models to robot controllers using the OpenAI Agents SDK
- **RAG-Powered Assistance**: An embedded chatbot grounded in book content to help you learn

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should have:

- **Python programming experience** (intermediate level)
- **Basic command-line proficiency** (terminal/shell usage)
- **Linux environment access** (Ubuntu 22.04, WSL2 on Windows, or similar)

No prior robotics experience is required — we'll teach you everything from the ground up.

## How This Book is Organized

The book is structured into **modules**, each covering a major topic area:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Learn the foundation of robot software development:
- ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Python programming with rclpy
- Robot description with URDF

### Future Modules

Additional modules covering AI agents, perception, control, and deployment are planned.

## Code Examples

All code examples in this book are:
- **Complete and runnable** — no missing imports or hidden dependencies
- **Tested against ROS 2 Humble** — the current Long-Term Support release
- **Available in the repository** — find them in the `examples/` directory

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. Check the **Further Reading** section at the end of each chapter
2. Use the **embedded RAG chatbot** (coming soon) to ask questions about book content
3. Consult the official [ROS 2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)

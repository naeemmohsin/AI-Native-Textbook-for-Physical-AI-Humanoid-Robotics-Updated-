# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to **Module 1** of the Physical AI & Robotics book. In this module, you'll learn the foundation of robot software development using **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) — the middleware that powers modern humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Understand ROS 2 Architecture**: Explain how nodes, topics, services, and actions form the communication backbone of robotic systems
- **Write Python Robot Code**: Build functional ROS 2 nodes using rclpy that publish, subscribe, and provide services
- **Define Robot Structure**: Create URDF files that describe robot geometry, joints, and physical properties

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters, each building on the previous:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Learn the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture:
- Nodes as independent processes
- Topics for publish/subscribe communication
- Services for request/response patterns
- Actions for long-running tasks with feedback
- Workspace and package structure

### Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy

Master Python programming for ROS 2:
- The rclpy library and Node class
- Creating publishers and subscribers
- Implementing service servers and clients
- Bridging AI agents to robot controllers

### Chapter 3: Humanoid Description with URDF

Define robot structure using URDF:
- Links and joints
- Visual, collision, and inertial properties
- Coordinate frames and transformations
- Visualization with RViz2

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- **ROS 2 Humble** installed (see [ROS 2 Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for setup instructions)
- **Python 3.10+** with basic programming experience
- **Ubuntu 22.04** or WSL2 on Windows

## Time Estimate

This module is designed to be completed in approximately **4-6 hours** of focused study, including hands-on exercises.

# Tasks: Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ros2-module/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, content-model.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested - code examples will be verified manually against ROS 2 Humble.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (chapter) to enable independent content creation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1=Chapter 1, US2=Chapter 2, US3=Chapter 3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Documentation**: `docs/module-1-ros2/` for chapter Markdown files
- **Examples**: `examples/module-1/` for runnable code samples
- **Static assets**: `static/img/module-1/` for diagrams and images
- **Docusaurus config**: Root level (`docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts`)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on T009 (Docusaurus builds)
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on T013 (placeholder files created)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on T013 - can run in parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on T013 - can run in parallel with US1/US2
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - can start after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Independent - can start after Phase 2 (may reference Chapter 1 concepts)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Independent - can start after Phase 2 (may reference Chapter 1-2 concepts)

### Within Each User Story

- Content sections should be written sequentially (builds progressively)
- Diagrams (marked [P]) can be created in parallel with content
- Code examples (marked [P]) can be created in parallel with content
- Verification tasks depend on content and examples being complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003-T008: All setup directory tasks can run in parallel
- T023-T026: All Chapter 1 diagrams can run in parallel
- T040-T042: All Chapter 2 diagrams can run in parallel
- T043-T047: All Chapter 2 code examples can run in parallel
- T059-T062: All Chapter 3 diagrams can run in parallel
- T063-T066: All Chapter 3 URDF/launch files can run in parallel
- All three user stories can be worked on in parallel after Phase 2

---

## Parallel Execution Example: Phase 1 Setup

```bash
# Launch all directory creation tasks together:
Task: "Create static/img/module-1/ directory"
Task: "Create examples/module-1/chapter-1/ directory"
Task: "Create examples/module-1/chapter-2/ directory"
Task: "Create examples/module-1/chapter-3/ directory"

# Launch config tasks together:
Task: "Configure sidebars.ts"
Task: "Create docs/intro.md"
```

## Parallel Execution Example: User Story 2 Code Examples

```bash
# Launch all Python examples together:
Task: "Create publisher_node.py in examples/module-1/chapter-2/"
Task: "Create subscriber_node.py in examples/module-1/chapter-2/"
Task: "Create service_server.py in examples/module-1/chapter-2/"
Task: "Create service_client.py in examples/module-1/chapter-2/"
Task: "Create ai_bridge_node.py in examples/module-1/chapter-2/"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Chapter 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Docusaurus initialized)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (module structure)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Chapter 1 - ROS 2 Fundamentals)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Chapter 1 complete, builds, all examples work
5. Deploy preview if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Site structure ready
2. Chapter 1 → Test independently → Deploy Preview (MVP!)
3. Chapter 2 → Test independently → Deploy Update
4. Chapter 3 → Test independently → Deploy Update
5. Polish → Final deployment

### Parallel Author Strategy

With multiple content authors:

1. Lead completes Setup + Foundational
2. Once Phase 2 is done:
   - Author A: Chapter 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals)
   - Author B: Chapter 2 (rclpy)
   - Author C: Chapter 3 (URDF)
3. Chapters complete independently, cross-review for consistency

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US1/US2/US3] labels map to chapters for traceability
- Each chapter is independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate chapter independently
- Diagrams can be Mermaid (inline) or PNG (static/img/)
- Code examples must run on ROS 2 Humble without modification
